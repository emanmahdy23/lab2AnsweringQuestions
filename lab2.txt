2. What is a Pull Request and Request? What's the difference between them?

Pull Request (PR):

A pull request is a GitHub (or Git-based platform) feature used when you want to merge changes from one branch or fork into another (usually into the main branch of a repository).

It's typically used in collaborative workflows, especially in open-source projects.

A PR allows for code review, discussion, CI tests, etc., before merging.

Request (in general):

A request is a more general term. It could mean asking for something (like a change, a resource, or even access).

In Git terms, it's not a specific command or featureâ€”Pull Request is the correct term.

Difference:

"Pull Request" is a specific version control feature.

"Request" is a general action (not specific to Git)
